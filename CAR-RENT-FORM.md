### Ahmad K. Work

I created the Car company Form, i created a class and passed the database keys as states, the form have a change handle function and on submit, for the post request i used the axios npm package, it does a post request to the 'api/v1/car-company' route, but the response is 500 because you need to be signed in as a user or admin to have the ability to POST on the API. I changed a lot of things about the code. 

added some scss files, a style folder and created basic css. to see if the css is applied to the components. Until now i created the header, footer, and car-company form. and created a snapshot test for every component and all are passing.
