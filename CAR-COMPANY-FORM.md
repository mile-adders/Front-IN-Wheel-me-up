### Ahmad K. Work

created a form that is able to POST and GET, data from an API. In this Form and The other one i had a 500 Error, because i don't have authentication to do POST and GET requests, because of ACL. The Get is tested on other APIs and it works, still the form needs to be tested when the sign in and sign up is figured out.
