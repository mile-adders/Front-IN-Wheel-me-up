  <h2 id='about'>About the Curve Project</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Curve is an application intended to accelerate your personal and professional growth curve over time by working towards growth milestones. Evaluate your progress by scoring your technical and professional proficiencies and track your improvement over time.</p>

    <p>Based on Mediumâ€™s open source Snowflake Project, this application represents the interdisciplinary efforts of an amazing group of twenty C# and JavaScript developers over a 4 day time period. </p>
      
    <p>The current application uses a C# backend to provide user authorization and database management for a JavaScript React/Gatsby front end utilizing Apollo/GraphQL in order to setup an initial application based on client requirements that can be built upon by future developers.</p>

    <p>To this end, we have worked hard to create an initial roadmap for the success of those that come after us.</p>
